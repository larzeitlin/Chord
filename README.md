# Chord
Stand-alone MIDI tool with circle of fifths interface made in python mode, Processing.

Chord uses a musically logical digramatic interface to help the user understand the patterns and shapes involved with harmony and chords in western music.

This stand-alone tool can send MIDI messages to DAWs like Logic and Ableton Live, to write MIDI directly. This works around the restriction that MIDI AU and VST plug-ins have of not being able to write MIDI to the session in real time.
